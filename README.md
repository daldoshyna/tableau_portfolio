# 🎵 Spotify Music Trends Analysis | Tableau Portfolio Project

## 📌 Project Summary

This project explores how tracks, artists, and genres relate to popularity and listener behaviour over time using Spotify streaming data.

The objective was to apply exploratory data analysis and data visualisation techniques to identify patterns, trends, and relationships that explain what drives popularity in the music industry.

The analysis is based on a public Spotify dataset containing track-level, artist-level, and genre-level information, including popularity metrics, release dates, explicit content indicators, and follower counts.
